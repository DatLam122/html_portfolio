    <h1> My hobbies</h1>
    <ul>
        <h2><li>Tennis</li></h2>
        <p> I started playing tennis since 9th grade and I found the sport to be a perfect activities
            for bettering not just your cardio and reacting time, but it is extremely trategic in term 
            of finding the right angles and corner to move the ball to, which is extremely fun to me!
        </p>
        
        <h2><li> Bowling </li> </h2>         
        <p> 
            I recently felt in love with the sport because a close friend of mine decided
            to show me some new moves and different ways to throw the bowling balls which
            has changed the definition of bowling in my point of view.
        </p>
        
        <h2><li> Jiujitsu </li></h2>
        <p> Combat sport has been a big thing for me since I was little, due to the fact that my 
            grandpa used to watch a lot of MMA and Boxing matches. Personally I have never step into 
            a cage because I am terrify of brain damage and being punched in the face, that is why I 
            choose Jiu jitsu because there is less to none impact to the head.
